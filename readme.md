The CE C Toolchain incorporates a variety of tools in order to build programs in C/C++ natively for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator series.

## Getting Started

Visit the [CE C Toolchain documentation](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain).
This site hosts all the information for working with the toolchain.

Or just grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/latest).

## Getting Help

You can join the `#ez80-dev` EFnet IRC channel for quick questions (any IRC client will work, but you can use a web-based one like IRCCloud if you prefer)

Depending on how active the channel is you might not get a response. In that case, post your questions [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/issues), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
