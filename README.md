# Toolchain
Toolchain for C programming on the TI CE calculators (TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE)

# Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/latest)
2. Extract the .zip in a folder somewhere (you should see one called 'CEdev')
3. Add an environment variable called `CEDEV`, pointing to the CEdev folder _(instructions on how to do that on: [Windows](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm), [Mac](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7502061/378298), [Linux](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/117470))_
3. Add the `bin` folder of the CEdev one to your system's PATH variable _(instructions on how to do that on: [Windows](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm), [Mac](http://architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/#.VqkncZMwiV5), [Linux](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14638025/378298))_

Once that is complete, you are ready to begin using the toolchain.
